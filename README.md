# **Project Spam Detection**

As a software developer, email is one of the very important tool for communication.
In today's world we receive lotsof spam and we would want to design a system that can detect messages and mark it as spam.

**TODO**:
- Build a Model that detect Spam and mark it as a spam
- Build a System that can update its database with more spam data and refresh the model as and when it learns something new. 
    - This needs to be done either as event based or periodically run the machine learning process.
    - Build the system, by using software architecture and design principles. The Software should be scalable and can be used by external entities.
- Train data should be stored in a secure way that no one can tamper with it easily.
- Build documentation for your software
